# Randle (wordle clone)

After becoming addicted to wordle, I decided to make my own version of the game called Randle. The difference being that a dataset of random words from 4 letters to 8 is being used, each day a new word from the set will be available to play.

The format doesn't go beyond a prototype as when the words become long, this game becomes unenjoyable. Thinking of words with only non-excluded letters (as in the original game rules) of 7 or 8 letters is taxing at best.

Also, redesigned the UI - think it looks quite simple and sleek
